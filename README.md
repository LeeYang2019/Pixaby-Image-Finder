# Pixaby-Image-Finder

## Description
This application allows users to enter a search term, which the application uses to fetch information from the pixabay api. Images are returned matching the search term.

Much thanks go to Brad Traversy for the tutorial. I learned how to use the pixaby api to fetch images and, using Material UI, display those images on an aesthetically pleasing UI.
